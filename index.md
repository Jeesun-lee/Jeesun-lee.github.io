## About me

Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently in SKKU University, [COCOAN lab](https://cocoanlab.github.io/) as a post-master research assistant in South Korea. I am very grateful for all the people who have helped me to get to where I am today, including my family, friends, lover, and advisors I have met. 

My path has been geared towards studying **_couples_** and **_marital relationships_** at the beginning of my university life. During the undergraduate program I aimed to study the effects of conflict between parents on children's mental health, while in the master’s program, I aimed to deeply learn the spectrum of psychopathology that individuals may experience. Through professional experience as a clinical psychologist, family dynamics and one’s difficulty within were observed. Now, I am ready to focus on research that includes core relationship named couples.

Life is short, so there is not enough time just to have a happy life. Conflict in the relationship inevitably occurs, but I believe that the satisfaction of the society, as well as the individual, can be increased depending on how well the expert can find meaning through research and intervene for relational distress. It is what I aim to do during the Ph.D. program and throughout my life.
